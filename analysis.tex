% \begin{flushleft}
    \subsection{Analysis overview}
The goal of TASEH is to find the axion signal hidden in the noise. In 
order to achieve this, the analysis procedure includes the following steps:
    \begin{enumerate}
        %\item Read raw data (I, Q) from tdms file and do Fast Fourier transform every 1 millisecond of spectrum, then average all over spectra in 1 second to get power spectrum.
        \item Perform fast Fourier transform (FFT) on the 
time-dependent spectrum to obtain the frequency-dependent spectrum.
        %\item Divide the measured power by the gains from the receiver chain to retrieve real power from cavity.
        %\item HEMT drift to predict noise and gain from the environmental parameters.
        %\item Use the results of high-electron-mobility-transistor(HEMT) drifting (see Section \ref{hemt_drifting}) to predict adding noise and gain; the input environmental parameters include monitoring temperatures, voltages of power supplies, etc.
        %\item Use Savitzky-Golay filter \cite{SGFilter} to remove the spectrum structure, then subtract the mean power.
        \item Apply Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter to remove the 
Lorentzian structure of the frequency-dependent spectrum.
        \item Combine all power spectra from different frequency scans with 
the weighting algorithm.
        %\item Cause the expected Axion bandwidth, and our frequency resolution is 1KHz, so we need to merge the bin.
        \item Merge bins in the combined spectrum to maximize the SNR.
        %\item Set threshold at ${3.355\ \sigma}$.
        \item Set limit on the axion-two-photon coupling \gagg.
    \end{enumerate}

    The analysis was done by closely following the procedure adopted by the 
HAYSTAC experiment ~\cite{HAYSTACII}.

%\subsection{Tdms}
\subsection{Fast Fourier transform}
%For each frequency scan, we collected data for 12.5 hours. The recorded data were stored in TDMS files (Technical Data Management Streaming - binary file format developed by \textbf{National Instruments}). Each TDMS file contains 2 millions data points corresponding to 1000 time dependent subspectra. We performed Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on each subspectrum to get the power in frequency (Eq.\ref{eq:4.1}).The I and Q in Eq.\ref{eq:4.1} are the raw data in voltage, R (50 Ohms) is the resistor of the signal analyzer, and 2000 is the number of data points. Finally, we averaged every 1000 successive subspectra to obtain the mean power in one second.
The time-dependent I and Q data were recorded and saved in the TDMS 
(Technical Data Management Streaming) files - a 
binary format developed by National Instruments.
%Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was performed to convert the data into frequency-dependent and into unit of power by using the equation:
The fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was performed to convert the data into 
frequency-dependent spectrum in which the measured power was calculated 
using the following equation:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:4.1}
    \text{Power} = \frac{|\text{FFT}(I+i \cdot Q)|^{2}}{N \cdot 2R},
\end{equation}

where $N$ is the number of data points ($N  = 2000$ in the TASEH 
CD102 data), and $R$ is the resistance of the signal analyzer (50~$\Omega$).
The FFT was done for every one-second subspectrum data.

%\subsection{Gain}
%The net gain of our receiver chain includes: down conversion gain, Intermediate Frequency(IF)  attenuator, Radio Frequency(RF) attenuator and HEMT gain. The first three were the parameters set during data taking, the last one was estimated from calibration (Section \ref{sec:}). Fig.\ref{fig:Hemt_gain} shows the gain and noise from the HEMT calibration done before the data run.
%\newline
%After removing all the gains, we got the real power going out from the antenna of the cavity. The variation of the real power in time is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:over_temp}. One possible cause of this effect came from the additional gain variation that was not studied in the initial HEMT calibration before taking data. To investigate this issue, we did HEMT drifting to check the behavior of the gain over time.

%\subsection{Savitzky Golay filter}
\subsection{Remove the Lorentzian structure}
%Figure \ref{fig:sg_result} is the spectrum in each step, somehow they all have a similar structure, in order to remove this structure, we will use a Savitzky Golay filter in every second to smooth the data Figure \ref{fig:After_Sg}.

In the absence of the axion signal, the output data spectrum is simply the 
noise from the cavity and the amplification chain. If the axions are present 
in the cavity, the signal power will be buried in the noise because the 
signal is very weak. Therefore, the structure of the raw output power 
spectrum, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:raw_sg_power}, is dominated by 
the product of the noise and the gain of the system. The Savitzky Golay (SG) 
filter~\cite{SGFilter}, a digital filter that can smooth data without 
distorting the signal tendency, was applied to remove the structure of the  
background. The SG filter was performed on the averaged spectrum of each 
frequency scan by fitting adjacent points of successive sub-sets of data with 
an $n^\text{th}$-order polynomial. The result depends on two parameters: 
the number of 
data points used for fitting, the so-called window width, and the order of 
the polynomial. If the window is too wide, the filter will not remove small 
structures, and if it is too narrow, it may kill the signal. 
The window and the order were first chosen during the data taking based on 
the structure of data and the ratio of the raw data to the filter output. 
After the data taking, they were optimized by injecting an axion signal on top of 
the noise data and found that they were consistent with the original choice 
(see Section~\ref{sec:sys}). 

The raw averaged spectrum was divided by the output of the SG filter and 
subtracted by unity to get the normalized spectrum (Fig.~\ref{fig:raw_sg_power}).
Therefore, if the axion signal exists, a power excess will be above zero.
%After filtering, the normalized spectrum (Fig. \cite{fig:}) was obtained by dividing the raw spectrum by the output of the SG filter subtract 1. Therefore, if the signal exists, the excess power will be above 0.
During the data taking, the resonant frequency of the cavity was  
adjusted by the tuning bar so to scan a large range of frequencies and to 
reduce the uncertainty of the noise at the overlapped region. Therefore, the 
spectra of all the scans need to be combined to create one big spectrum. 
Before doing this, 
the normalized spectrum from each scan was rescaled by the system noise 
(detailed in Sec~\ref{sec:calibration}) and the signal power with the cavity 
Lorentzian shape taken into account. The rescaled spectrum, shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:raw_sg_power}, was computed with the following formula:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:respower_eqn}
  \delta_{ij}^{res} = \frac{k_{B}T_{sys}\Delta\nu \delta_{ij}^{norm}}{P_{ij}^{s} h},
\end{equation}

and the standard deviation of each bin is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ressigma_eqn}
  \sigma_{ij}^{res} = \frac{k_{B}T_{sys}\Delta\nu \sigma_{i}^{norm}}{P_{ij}^{s} h},
\end{equation}

where $\delta_{ij}^{norm}$ ($\delta_{ij}^{res}$) and $\sigma_{i}^{norm}$ ($\sigma_{ij}^{res}$)
are the power and the standard deviation of the $j^\text{th}$ frequency bin from the 
 $i^\text{th}$ normalized (rescaled) spectrum. The $\Delta\nu$ is the bin width of 
spectrum (1~kHz) and  $P_{ij}^{s}$ is the KSVZ axion signal power. The 
$h = \frac{1}{1 + [2(\nu_{ij} - \nu_{ci})/\Delta\nu_{i}]^2}$ 
describes the Lorentzian shape of the cavity, where 
$\Delta\nu_{i}$ is the cavity line width, which depends on the resonant 
frequency $\nu_{ci}$ and the loaded quality factor. 
%
If a signal appears in a certain frequency bin $j^{th}$, its expected power 
will be enhanced or reduced depending on the bin position due to the cavity's 
Lorentzian shape. The rescaling will take into account this effect.

%First we will choose a window and a order, then move the window and fit the data a with a polynomial with chosen order, it is a kind of generalization  moving average characterized, if the windows is too big, then it will not remove small structures, if it too small, it may kill the signal, you can see that choosing an appropriate window is important, a way to test if the windows are appropriate is to see the system temperature calculated by  $\mu$ and $\sigma$.

%\begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:ts_mu}
%    \mu = k_{B} \cdot T_{S} \cdot \Delta \nu 
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:ts_sigma}
%    \sigma = \frac{k_{B} \cdot T_{S} \cdot \Delta \nu}{\sqrt{N}}
%\end{equation}

%If we treat the spectrum after the SG filter as a pure noise, we know that the system temperature of a white noise can be calculated by $\mu$ and $\sigma$ (Eq.\eqref{eq:ts_mu}) (Eq.\eqref{eq:ts_sigma}),
%where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T_{S}$ is the system temperature, $\Delta \nu$ is the frequency resolution and N is the number of averaging. \\
%If the chosen window is appropriate, the system temperature estimated from $\mu$ and $\sigma$ should be consistent  with each other. \\

%We also did some studies to check if the SG filter removed the axion signal. Assuming a signal bandwidth of 5 kHz, we added the signal into noise spectrum and applied the SG filter. The result shows that the filter does not suppress the axion signal as given in Fig.\ref{fig:weighted_snr}.

%about whether the sg filter will remove the Axion signal, assuming the Axion signal bandwidth is 5KHz, add the signal in a white noise and apply the sg filter , the results show that it will not affect much before and after use, after divide the sg filter result, we will subtract 1 to make the value become 1.

\subsection{Combine the spectra with the weighting algorithm} 
\label{sec:weighting_algorithm}

The purpose of the weighting algorithm is to add different spectra vertically, particularly for the frequency bins that appear in multiple spectra.  %Each spectrum in Fig.\ref{fig:After_Sg}
Each spectrum was collected with a different cavity resonant frequency. Therefore, if a signal appears in a certain frequency bin $j^{th}$, due to the difference in resonant frequency and Lorentzian shape, the expected signal power will be different in each spectrum $i$. The weighting algorithm is expected to take this into account with weight calculated for each bin j of normalized spectrum i defined in Eq.\cite{eq:weight}.
The weighted power $\delta^{com}_{n}$ and standard deviation $\sigma^{com}_{n}$ of each bin $n$ in the combined spectrum are calculated using Eq.~\ref{eq:comb_power} and Eq.~\ref{eq:comb_sigma}, respectively. The SNR is the ratio of $\delta^{com}_{n}$ and $\sigma^{com}_{n}$ as given in Eq.~\ref{eq:comb_snr}.


\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:weight}
    %    {w_{n}}^{i} = \frac{h \cdot p}{(\sigma_{n}^{i})^{2}}
    {w_{j}} = \frac{1}{(\sigma_{ij}^{res})^{2}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:comb_power}
    \delta_{n}^{com} = \frac{ \sum_{1}^{k}\delta_{ij}^{res} \cdot {w_{ij}}}{\sum_{1}^{k} {w_{ij}}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:comb_sigma}
    \sigma_{n}^{com} = \frac{ \sqrt{\sum_{1}^{k}(\sigma_{ij}^{res} \cdot {w_{ij}})^2}}{\sum_{1}^{k} {w_{ij}}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:comb_snr}
    {SNR}_{n}^{com} = \frac{\delta^{com}_{n}}{\sigma^{com}_{n}}= \frac{\sum_{1}^{k}\delta_{ij}^{res} \cdot {w_{ij}}^{res}}{ \sqrt{\sum_{1}^{k}(\sigma_{ij}^{res} \cdot {w_{ij}}^{res})^2}}
\end{equation}

with i running from 1 to k - number of spectra containing bin j.

    \caption{Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) calculated using Eq.\eqref{eq:comb_snr} of the combined spectrum }
    \label{fig:SNR_comb}
\end{figure}


%where ${\delta_n^i}$ and ${\sigma_n^i}$ are the measured power and the corresponding standard deviation of the ${n^{\mathrm{th}}}$ frequency bin of the ${i^{\mathrm{th}}}$ spectrum., From the weighted power in ${n^{th}}$ bin in Eq.\eqref{eq:weighted_power}, and weighted $\sigma$ in Eq.\eqref{eq:weighted_sigma}, we can get our Signal to noise ratio as Eq.\eqref{eq:weighted_SNR}

\subsection{Merging bins}

With the quality factor of $10^6$, the expected axion bandwidth is of 5 kHz at frequency of 5 GHz. In this paper, our interested range is 4.7 - 4.8 GHz and the bin width is of 1 kHz. Therefore, in order to maximize the SNR, we merged M = 5 consecutive bins with overlapping of the combined spectrum to construct a final spectrum.
The purpose of overlapping is to avoid the signal power broken into different neighbouring bins of the merged spectrum. Before defining weights for merging, we multiplied the power and standard deviation of each bin in the combined spectrum by M: $\delta^{c}_n \rightarrow M\delta^{com}_n$ and $\sigma^{c}_n \rightarrow M \sigma^{com}_n$. This rescaling gives the expected mean of the normalized power $\mu^{com}_k = 1$ if a KSVZ axion signal power leaves a fraction of 1/M of its power in the combined spectrum bin k.
Then the maximum likelihood weights, defined in Eq.~\ref{eq:merge_weight} based on the the Maxwellian lineshape for axion (Eq.~(\ref{eq:simplesignal})), were used to build the merged spectrum.

%In theory, the expected Axion bandwidth is 5KHz, and our frequency resolution is 1KHz, therefore we need to merge 5 bins. Due to the expected Maxwellian signal line shape, a weight will be applied when merging five neighbouring bins

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:merge_weight}
    %w_{q} = \frac{L_{q}}{(\sigma_{q}^{com}/5)^{2}}
    w_{q} = \frac{L_{q}}{(\sigma_{q}^{c})^{2}} = \frac{L_{q}}{(M\sigma_{q}^{com})^{2}}
\end{equation}

where M = 5 is the number of merged bins.

%\begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:axion_line_shape}
%    f(\nu) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sqrt{\nu - \nu_a} \left( \frac{3}{\nu_a \big \langle \beta^{2} \big \rangle }\right)^{\frac{3}{2}} e^{- \frac{3(\nu-\nu_a)}{\nu_a \big \langle \beta^{2} \big \rangle}}
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:Lq_integtal}
    L_{q} = \int_{\nu_a +\nu_q + q\Delta\nu}^{\nu_a +\nu_q + (q+1)\Delta\nu} f(\nu) \,d\nu
\end{equation}

where $L_q$ is the integral of the lineshape from the lower edge to higher edge of ${q^{th}}$ bin
%$\sigma_{q}^{com}^{2}$ is the standard deviation of the combined spectrum as defined in Eq.\cite{eq:weighted_sigma}.
The power, standard deviation and SNR of the merged spectrum are:

%We have a weight Eq.\eqref{eq:merge_weight}, where Lq is the area in ${q^{th}}$ bin and $\sigma_{q}$ is the weighted $\sigma$ in the $q^{\mathrm{th}}$ bin , Eq.\eqref{eq:axion_line_shape} is the axion CDM(cold dark matter) line shape, where $\big \langle \beta^{2} \big \rangle = \big \langle v^{2} \big \rangle /c^{2}$ and $\big \langle v^{2} \big \rangle = (270km/s)^{2}\ , \big \langle v^{2} \big \rangle$ is the squared virial velocity. Eq.\eqref{eq:L_q_integtal},

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:merged_power}
    \delta_{q}^{merged} = k \cdot \frac{ \sum_{i = q-k/2}^{q+k/2}\delta_{q}^{i} \cdot {w_{q}}}{\sum_{i = q-k/2}^{q+k/2} {w_{q}}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:merged_sigma}
%    (\sigma_{merged})_q = k \cdot \frac{ \sqrt{\sum_{i = q-k/2}^{q+k/2} (\sigma_{norm})_{q}^{i} \cdot {w_{q}}}}{\sum_{i = q-k/2}^{q+k/2} {w_{q}}^{2}}
    %    (\sigma_{merged})_q = k \cdot \frac{ \sqrt{\sum_{i = q-k/2}^{q+k/2} ((\sigma_{norm})_{q}^{i}/M)^2 \cdot {(w_{q})^2}}}{\sum_{i = q-k/2}^{q+k/2} {w_{q}}}
    \sigma_{q}^{merged} = k \cdot \frac{ \sqrt{\sum_{i = q-k/2}^{q+k/2} (\sigma_{q}^{i})^2 \cdot {w_{q}^2}}}{\sum_{i = q-k/2}^{q+k/2} {w_{q}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:merged_snr}
    {SNR}_{q}^{merged} = \frac{\delta^{merged}_{q}}{\sigma^{merged}_{q}} = \frac{\sum_{i = q-k/2}^{q+k/2}\delta_{q}^{i} \cdot {w_{q}}}{ \sqrt{\sum_{i = q-k/2}^{q+k/2} (\sigma_{q}^{i})^2 \cdot {w_{q}^2}}}
\end{equation}

%Adding adjacent bin with a weight Eq.\eqref{eq:merged_power} Eq.\eqref{eq:merged_sigma}, where k is the number of adjacent bin to be merged, q is ${q^{th}}$ merged bin, with Eq.\eqref{eq:merged_sigma}, we can get our weighted merged power spectrum FIG.\ref{fig:merged_data}.

\end{figure}


After the merging, if there is any potential signal with SNR larger than 3.355 $\sigma$,
the rescan will be proceeded to check it is real signal or statistical fluctuation.
Our procedure was rescan after covering every 10 MHz range and it was done by adjusting
the tuning rod of the cavity to match the resonant frequency to the candidate.
Most of the candidates were from the fluctuations because they were gone after few rescans.
Some of them reached SNR = 3.355 $\sigma$ after rescanning, a portable antenna outside the DR was used
to probe if they came from external sources. During the data taking, several external signals from the instruments
in the laboratory were detected. More details can be found in the instrumentation paper ref~\cite{}.
