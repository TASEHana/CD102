\section{Analysis of the Synthetic Axion Data}
After TASEH finished collecting the CD102 data on November 15, 2021, 
the synthetic axion signals were injected into the cavity and read out via the 
same transmission line and amplification chain. The procedure 
to generate axion-like signals is summarized in 
Ref.~\cite{TASEHInstrumentation}. 
Due to the uncertainties on the losses of readout electronics and transmission
 lines, the synthetic axion signals were not used to perform an absolute 
calibration of the search sensitivity. Instead, 
a test with synthetic axion signals could be used to verify the procedures of 
data acquisition and physics analysis. The 
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the frequency bin with maximum power from the 
synthetic axion signals, at 4.708972~GHz, was set to $\approx 3.35\sigma$, 
corresponding to a power of $\approx 6.03 \times 10^{-13}$~W in a 1-kHz 
frequency bin.  

Figures~\ref{fig:faxionstep}--\ref{fig:faxioncombine} present respectively the 
raw power spectra in 24 frequency scans and the spectrum with the corresponding 
SNR after combining the 24 spectra vertically. Before combining 
the 24 spectra vertically, the SNR of the maximum-power bin from the spectrum 
with a cavity resonant frequency of 4.708918~GHz was measured to be 
3.577$\sigma$; the SNR was slightly higher than 3.35$\sigma$ due to a 
5\% difference in the noise fluctuation between the measurements from 
the calibration and the measurements taken 
right before injecting axion-like signals. After the vertical combination 
of power spectra and the merging of five frequency bins, the SNR increased to 
4.74$\sigma$ and 6.12$\sigma$, respectively. In addition to the 
injected synthetic axion signal, a candidate at xxxx GHz was found after 
combining the spectra. Since it was not possible to perform a rescan later, 
the real axion data from the two scans that had resonant frequencies close to the 
candidate frequency were added so to mimic the rescan; the candidate 
 disappeared afterwards and was a statistical fluctuation.  
Figure~\ref{fig:faxionmerge} presents the power spectrum after merging five 
neighboring bins as described in Section~\ref{sec:merge}, 
including both the 24 scans of the synthetic axion data and the two scans 
of the real axion data. 
The analysis results of the synthetic axion signals proved that an power 
excess of more than 5$\sigma$ can be found at the expected frequencies via 
the standard analysis procedure.
