\section{Results}
In Fig.\ref{fig:SNR_histogram}, we set a threshold at $3.355\sigma$, if the expected signal is 5 $\sigma$ above the noise level, the signal is supposed to have $95\% $ of the chance passing the cut at 3.355 sigma. However, a signal was not observed. Therefore, with $95{\%}$ C.L., the signal cannot be larger than 5 $\sigma$.
