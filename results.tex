\section{Results} \label{sec:results}
Figure~\ref{fig:glimit} shows the ratio of the limits on \ggamma\ with respect 
to the KSVZ benchmark value ($\ggamma=-0.97$) while Fig.~\ref{fig:gagglimit} 
shows the results of the limits on \gagg. Figure~\ref{fig:gaggall} displays 
the limits on \gagg\ obtained by TASEH with those from the previous searches. 
The error bands indicate the systematic uncertainties as discussed in 
Section~\ref{sec:sys}. No limits were placed for the frequency bins 
that correspond to external signal sources during the collection of CD102 
data. The results of TASEH exclude the models with the axion-two-photon
coupling $\gagg\gtrsim \avelimit\GeVinv$, a factor of ten above the benchmark
KSVZ model for the mass range $\mlo < \ma < \mhi \muevcc$ (corresponding to 
the frequency range of $\flo < \nu_a < \fhi$). 

The central results shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:glimit}--\ref{fig:gaggall} were 
obtained assuming an axion signal line shape that follows 
Eq.~\ref{eq:simplesignal}. Both the analysis that merges bins without including
 a weight from the signal line shape and the one 
that assumes a simple Gaussian weight, with a mean at the center of the five 
frequency bins and a width $\sigma$ 
giving half-maximum-weight when the frequency 
is 2.5~kHz away from the center, i.e. 
$\sigma=\left.5~\text{kHz}\middle/2\sqrt{2\ln2}\right.$, produce limits that 
are 5-6\% higher than the central results.
