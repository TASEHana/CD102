\section{Conclusion} 
This paper presents the first results of a search for axions for the mass 
range $\mlo < \ma < \mhi \muevcc$, using the data collected by the Taiwan 
Axion Experiment with Haloscope from October 13, 2021 to November 15, 2021. 
Apart from external signals, no candidates with significance more than
3.355$\sigma$ were found. The experiment excludes models with the 
axion-two-photon
coupling $\gagg\gtrsim \avelimit\GeVinv$, a factor of ten above the benchmark
KSVZ model. For the first time, 
constraints on the $\gagg$ have been placed in this mass region.
