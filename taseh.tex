\section{Experimental Setup}\label{sec:taseh} 
The detector of TASEH is located at the Department of Physics, National 
Central University, Taiwan and housed within a cryogen-free dilution 
refrigerator (DR) from BlueForcs. A 8-Tesla superconducting solenoid with a 
bore diameter of 76~mm and a length of 240 mm is integrated with the DR. 

The data for the analysis presented in this paper were collected by TASEH 
from October 13, 2021 to November 15, 2021, and termed as the CD102 data. 
During the data taking, the cavity sat in the center of the magnet bore 
and was connected via holders 
to the mixing chamber plate of the DR at a temperature of $\approx$30~mK. 
Due to an inefficiency of thermal conduction and thermal radiation, 
the temperature of the cavity stayed at 155~mK, higher with respect to the DR.
The cavity, made of oxygen-free high-conductivity (OFHC) copper, has an 
effective volume of 0.234~L and is a two-cell cylinder split along 
the axial direction ($z$-axis). 
The cylindrical cavity has an inner radius of 2.5~cm and a 
height of 12~cm.  In order to maintain a smooth surface, the cavity underwent 
the processes of polishing, chemical cleaning, and annealing. The resonance 
frequency of the TM$_{010}$ mode can be tuned over the range of 
4.717--4.999~GHz via the rotation of an off-axis OFHC copper tuning rod, from 
the position closer to the cavity wall to the position closer to the cavity 
center. The CD102 data cover the frequency range of \flo--\fhi~GHz. 
There were 839 frequency steps in total, with a frequency difference of 
95--115~kHz. The form factor $C_{010}$ as defined in Eq.~(\ref{eq:formfactor}) 
varies from 0.64 to 0.69 over the full frequency range.  
The intrinsic, unloaded quality factor $Q_0$ at the cryogenic temperature 
($T_\mathrm{cavity}\simeq 155$~mK) is $\simeq 60000$ at the frequency of 
4.74~GHz.

An output probe, made of a 50-$\Omega$ semi-rigid coaxial cable 
soldering SMA plug crimp, was inserted into the cavity and its depth was set for 
$\beta\simeq2$.  The signal from the output probe was directed to an 
impedance-matched amplification chain. The first-stage amplifier was 
a low noise high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier with an 
effective noise temperature of $\approx 2$~K, mounted on the 4K-flange. 
The signal was further amplified at room temperature and down-converted 
and demodulated to in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components and digitized 
by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with a sampling rate of 2~MHz. 
The frequency resolution of the spectra was 1~kHz.

A more detailed description of the TASEH detector, the operation of the 
data run, and the calibration of the gain and added noise temperature of HEMT 
 can be found in Ref.~\cite{TASEHInstrumentation}. 
See Table~\ref{tab:tasehbenchmark} for the benchmark experimental parameters that 
can be used to estimate the sensitivity of TASEH.
