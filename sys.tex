\section{Systematic Uncertainties}
In order to understand the systematic errors, We reviewed the steps of the analysis and listed the possible causes of systematic errors.

First is the SG filter, using different window and order will give us slightly different result, so we will try different SG filter and count them as systematic error.

Second is the gain, we donâ€™t understand much about Hemt gain now, so we use the calibrated gain before the data taking as our systematic error.

Third, when doing the weighting algorithm Section. \ref{weighting_algorithm}, $\sigma$ is included in the weight. In theory, the system temperature derived from  $\sigma$ and $\mu$ should be the same, But in Fig\ref{fig:system_temp}, they are not exactly the same, Therefore, a systematic uncertainty is derived by replacing $\sigma$ with $\frac{\mu}{\sqrt{N}}$, where $N$ is the number of spectra that share the same frequency bin.  


I will sum Up these limit with following formula.

error band = $\sqrt{(G_{\gamma1}-G_{\gamma0})^2+(G_{\gamma2}-G_{\gamma0})^2+... }$
